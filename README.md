# Lab 1

*Goal*: Get experience with the HTTP protocol.

## Description

Write a simple HTTP server that can serve up any file. A web browser should be able to make a request to your server and display a webpage. I've provided some boilerplate code in Python. You are welcome to do this lab in a different programming language, but I will only be able to help debug for C, C++, and Python. Your program must use with TCP sockets and not use a library that provides HTTP functionality. The server does not need to be multi-threaded or handle multiple requests at once (though you are welcome to implement that if you would like).
